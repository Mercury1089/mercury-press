# Mercury2017
Website theme for Mercury1089's WordPress site

Made with HTML, PHP, SASS, JS, and lots of love.

## Building SASS
To make building SASS easier for those without it,
a Gradle plugin has been included to allow those to
compile the source.

In a command line at the root of the project, run:

### Linux/macOS
`$ ./gradlew compileLibSass`

### Windows
`> gradlew compileLibSass`

You can also use `compileLibSassWithWatch` to
auto-compile files on change.
