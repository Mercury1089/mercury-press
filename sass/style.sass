 *Theme Name: Mercury2017
 *Author: Jared Tulayan
 *Description: A more modern look for the Team Mercury website. This includes having a more modular and customizable approach without having to go to far into the markup of the theme. Great for all the people that just want to make little changes without having to learn too much HTML or JavaScript or anything. Included support for an updated version of the Robot Pages plugin.
 *Version: 1.0
 *Tags: orange, silver, black, robots, modern

 *NOTE: If you are reading this in the style.css file, you are in the wrong place. This was developed with SASS, so the actual style files are in "/sass/"
